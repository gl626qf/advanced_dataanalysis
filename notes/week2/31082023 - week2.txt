Plan:
- Look at the exercises 15 min each
-- Write down the needed tools and reflect






_Question 1_
Only four points given
- Think of the binomial distribution
-- If more points the Poisson distribution would be better perhaps

Abstract.
A measurement of the 20Na β
-delayed alpha spectrum with a high-granularity setup has allowed the decay scheme to be revised on several points. Three new transitions of low intensity are found at low α
 -particle energy. An R-matrix fit of the complete spectrum gives an improved description of the decay and indicates feeding to the broad 2+ α
-cluster state close to 9MeV.


brainstorm: 
- Branching ratios
-- Decay of a specific mode


Q: question
PA: partial answer
A: 
I: idea
- Four detectors was used
-- Q: Does they detect the same thing?
--- PA: It is only one branching ratio which is determined
---- All alpha decay coming from a specific state

...
- The ratios was given in percent: 
-- 13.848(38)(18), 13.869(33)(20), 13.824(36)(24) and 13.923(39)(20)
. the first parenthesis gives the statistical error and the second the 
systematic error connected with cut-offs made in the spectrum etc.

...
- Can these four values be averaged, and how?
-- I: Fit the point in a binomial distribution in Python or C#
--- Maybe first in python
--- Q: Does this makes sense when dealing with the same ratio
---- Look up statistics: 
---- Would make sense, that the value is varying, but which probability function then, 
maybe the uniform distribution (because it is the same branching ratio). 


-- Q: How do I handle systematic error


The apparent lack of knowledge:
- Which distribution
- How to handle systematic error




_QUESTION 2:_ Bayes theorem
If object X exists, maybe be found in N locations with each posibilities
P prior belief of position of object X. 
1 unsuccesful investigation-> P' = (N-1)/(N-P)P.
If N = 10 and there is 9 unsuccesful searches 
- Calculate and contrast the final posteriors for a prior of 0.9 and of 0.99
