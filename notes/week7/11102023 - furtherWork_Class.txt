- Use better methods to fit
-- Maybe use chi2 and minimize




___Improving the program____:

making new version: week7/11102023_problem.ipynb


Maybe there is something wrong with the guess: 
- The fit does not work 
-> Trying out chi2 methode
--- Couldn't make it work
-> Need to find: 
-- What is the expected function 
-- How can I minimize chi2


-Thoughts_storm:
The data should be binned. Each bin contains a number of counts. Could the sqrt(counts) be used in this 
case? 
- This is not the case I think. The counts for each data could be a peak, and the number of counts
of that peak should be the error square-rooted.
- If this was the case, could a monte-carlo also be used to find the uncertainty?
-- Maybe it can be used now. Missing knowledge (MK): Why not just use sqrt(N) instead of montecarlo

The binned data, with the scipy.stats.expon.pdf makes a normalization.



____In class___
Always integrate over bins!!!
- Or determine you don't need to


Normalize fit functions!!!
- or else correlation 

In this problem: 
- integrate( p1p2exp(-p2*t)dt)_{t}^{t+Dt}


Counts are poisson distributed!
